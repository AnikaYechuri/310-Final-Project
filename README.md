# 310-Final-Project
For my project, I want to make a web application that uses a makeup brand API (stores
information about every drugstore makeup brand and their products) to help curate a makeup
routine for each person. My goal is to help people who want to get started with using makeup but
don’t know where to start. Oftentimes, it can be very expensive to buy and test out different
products until you find something that works for you. This tediousness can make getting into
makeup sound very scary. My app will take the user’s budget, preferences, and skin type and tell
them which products to buy.
The API I will use is this: http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json
It is an API that keeps track of all brands and all their products.
As mentioned before, this will be a web application. The user will go to the website and it will
first ask them to input their skin type and tone. Then it will ask them to input their budget and
finally what products they want to buy. I also want to have an “ I don’t know” option for all the
questions in case the user does not know anything about their skin or makeup. Then the
preferences will be set to some default options.
My plan is to split the major components into a two week timeline. The first part is getting the
API in a json format and also making sure I can extract the components I need. Next I need to
use the front-end portion where I ask the user about their preferences. I aim to take a week for
each part and use the last couple of days to test my app and make sure all the components
function as they are supposed to.
